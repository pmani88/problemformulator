ProblemFormulator
=================

Problem formulator is an interactive tool for aiding in problem
formulation that uses the problem map ontology. This tool has representations
and operations that let designers create, visualize, explore, and reflect on
their formulations. This tool was created to facilitate the study of the
relationship between problem formulation and creative outcome in engineering
design. Also, the system ultimately seeks to aid designers and enhance the
creativity of the final outcomes of their design sessions.
