        <h2>Participant Consent</h2>

        <p>This design strategy study is part of a research study conducted by Christopher
        MacLellan, Steven Dow, Ken Koedinger, and Chidambaram Bhat at Carnegie Mellon
        University.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of different ideation
        strategies on design outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <p>During this study, you will be asked complete a series of user interface
        design tasks. These tasks consist of coming up with ideas for various cell-phone
        applications and building low-fidelity prototypes to represent these ideas. If
        at any time you become frustrated or no longer want to participate, you may
        terminate your participation without consequence.</p>

        <p>We plan to keep your identity private, and separate from the information we
        collect. Your name will be replaced by a code name in all publications and
        presentations that are released to the public.</p>

        <h2>Expected Duration and Location</h2>

        <p>Your participation will involve one 1-hour session. This experiment will take
        place online.</p>

        entitled.</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>You may receive benefits from participation in the study, such as learning
        more about design principles. Additionally, the knowledge gained in this study
        may help improve methods of design education.</p>

        <h2>Compensation & Costs</h2>
        <p>We are providing $10-20 gift card, depending on design experience, as
        compensation. There is no additional cost to you for participating in this
